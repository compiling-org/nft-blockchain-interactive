# Interactive Creative NFTs on NEAR: Mintbase Integration & Marketplace

## Project Overview

**Organization**: Compiling.org
**Funding Request**: USD 10,000
**Timeline**: 3 months
**Repository**: https://github.com/compiling-org/nft-blockchain-interactive

## Abstract

We propose developing a comprehensive interactive NFT framework for NEAR that integrates with Mintbase's infrastructure. This will enable dynamic, emotionally-responsive NFTs that react to user interactions, environmental data, and real-time creative inputs - creating living digital art that evolves with its owners and the broader creative ecosystem.

## Why Mintbase Foundation?

Mintbase represents the premier NFT infrastructure on NEAR, providing:

- **Proven NFT Standards**: Battle-tested smart contracts used by thousands of creators
- **Marketplace Integration**: Seamless connection to existing trading platforms
- **Community Focus**: Emphasis on creator empowerment and accessible tooling
- **NEAR Ecosystem**: Deep integration with NEAR's high-performance blockchain

Our project will extend Mintbase's capabilities into the realm of interactive, emotionally-aware NFTs - creating a new category of "living" digital art that responds to human emotion and creative expression.

## Technical Approach

### Core Components

1. **Interactive NFT Engine**
   - Dynamic metadata that updates based on user interactions
   - Emotional state integration with NFT behavior
   - Real-time parameter modulation

2. **Mintbase Contract Extensions**
   - Enhanced NFT contracts with interactive capabilities
   - Soulbound token variants for identity and achievements
   - Cross-contract composability for complex creative pieces

3. **Marketplace Integration**
   - Mintbase-compatible metadata standards
   - Interactive preview systems for marketplace display
   - Creator tools for building dynamic NFT collections

### Implementation Details

```rust
// Interactive NFT contract extending Mintbase standards
#[near_bindgen]
#[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize, PanicOnDefault)]
pub struct InteractiveNftContract {
    // Mintbase-compatible token storage
    tokens: LookupMap<TokenId, Token>,
    token_metadata: LookupMap<TokenId, TokenMetadata>,

    // Interactive extensions
    interaction_history: LookupMap<TokenId, Vec<Interaction>>,
    emotional_state: LookupMap<TokenId, EmotionalData>,
    dynamic_metadata: LookupMap<TokenId, DynamicMetadata>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct DynamicMetadata {
    pub base_metadata: TokenMetadata,
    pub interaction_count: u64,
    pub last_interaction: Timestamp,
    pub emotional_evolution: EmotionalVector,
    pub current_state: serde_json::Value,
}

#[near_bindgen]
impl InteractiveNftContract {
    // Mint interactive NFT
    pub fn mint_interactive_nft(
        &mut self,
        token_id: TokenId,
        metadata: TokenMetadata,
        initial_emotion: EmotionalData,
    ) {
        // Mintbase-compatible minting with interactive extensions
    }

    // Record user interaction
    pub fn record_interaction(
        &mut self,
        token_id: TokenId,
        interaction_type: String,
        interaction_data: serde_json::Value,
    ) {
        // Update NFT state based on interaction
    }

    // Get current dynamic metadata
    pub fn get_dynamic_metadata(&self, token_id: TokenId) -> DynamicMetadata {
        // Return current state including interaction history
    }
}
```
