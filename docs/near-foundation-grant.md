# Real-Time WASM Creative Engine for NEAR (NUWE Core)

## Project Overview

**Organization**: Compiling.org
**Funding Request**: USD 10,000
**Timeline**: 3 months
**Repository**: https://github.com/compiling-org/nft-blockchain-interactive

## Abstract

We propose developing a Rust-to-WASM compilation module that enables direct deployment of our NUWE (Neuro-Unified Wave Environment) fractal shader engine as a NEAR Component (dApp) in the browser. This will create user-owned, real-time creative sessions that run entirely on-chain, democratizing access to high-performance creative tools as public goods.

## Why NEAR?

NEAR's WebAssembly (WASM) runtime provides the perfect environment for our creative computing vision:

- **Browser-Native Performance**: WASM enables desktop-quality creative tools to run directly in web browsers
- **True Ownership**: Users own their creative sessions and generated content
- **Instant Deployment**: No complex setup - creativity accessible to anyone with a browser
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, composable creative tools that can be mixed and matched

Traditional creative software requires expensive hardware and software licenses. NEAR's BOS (Blockchain Operating System) enables us to deploy professional-grade creative tools as public goods, accessible to anyone worldwide.

## Technical Approach

### Core Components

1. **WASM Shader Engine**
   - Rust-to-WASM compilation of fractal shader modules
   - WebGL/WebGPU integration for hardware acceleration
   - Real-time parameter manipulation interfaces

2. **NEAR Component Framework**
   - BOS-compatible component architecture
   - State management for creative sessions
   - Social features for collaborative creation

3. **Creative Session Persistence**
   - On-chain storage of session parameters
   - Shareable creative state snapshots
   - Version control for iterative creative processes

### Implementation Details

```rust
// WASM-compiled creative engine
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub struct NearCreativeEngine {
    shader_pipeline: ShaderPipeline,
    near_connection: NearConnection,
    session_state: SessionState,
}

#[wasm_bindgen]
impl NearCreativeEngine {
    // Initialize creative session on NEAR
    pub fn init_session(&mut self, user_account: &str) -> Result<(), JsValue> {
        // Implementation for session initialization
    }

    // Render frame with real-time parameters
    pub fn render_frame(&self, params: &JsValue) -> Result<JsValue, JsValue> {
        // Implementation for frame rendering
    }

    // Save creative state to NEAR
    pub fn save_session(&self) -> Result<String, JsValue> {
        // Implementation for state persistence
    }
}
```
