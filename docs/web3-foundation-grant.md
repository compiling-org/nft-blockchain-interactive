# Substrate Pallet: Decentralized Emotional State Proof PoC

## Project Overview

**Organization**: Compiling.org
**Funding Request**: USD 10,000
**Timeline**: 3 months
**Repository**: https://github.com/compiling-org/nft-blockchain-interactive

## Abstract

We propose developing a Substrate pallet architecture for a "Decentralized Emotional Identity/State Proof" system. This proof-of-concept will demonstrate how parachain infrastructure can provide cryptographic proofs of emotional states and creative authenticity, enabling new forms of decentralized identity and provenance for digital creative work.

## Why Web3 Foundation?

The Web3 Foundation's support for innovative Substrate-based projects aligns perfectly with our vision of building decentralized infrastructure for creative computing. Our pallet will:

- **Demonstrate Parachain Innovation**: Showcase novel uses of Substrate for creative applications
- **Advance Identity Systems**: Contribute to decentralized identity research
- **Enable Cross-Chain Creative Economies**: Foundation for multi-parachain creative ecosystems

## Technical Approach

### Core Components

1. **Emotional State Pallet**
   - On-chain emotional state recording and validation
   - Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving state verification
   - Integration with existing identity systems

2. **Creative Provenance System**
   - Cryptographic linking of emotional states to creative outputs
   - Timestamped proofs of creative authenticity
   - Verifiable chains of creative influence

3. **Parachain Integration**
   - XCM messaging for cross-parachain creative data
   - Shared security model for creative assets
   - Interoperability with other identity and creative parachains

### Implementation Details

```rust
// Substrate pallet for emotional state proofs
pub struct EmotionalStatePallet<T: Config>(PhantomData<T>);

#[pallet::config]
pub trait Config: frame_system::Config {
    // Configuration traits
}

#[pallet::pallet]
pub struct Pallet<T>(PhantomData<T>);

#[pallet::call]
impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
    // Record emotional state with privacy
    #[pallet::weight(10_000)]
    pub fn record_emotional_state(
        origin: OriginFor<T>,
        state_vector: Vec<u8>,
        proof: ProofOfPrivacy
    ) -> DispatchResult {
        // Implementation for state recording
    }

    // Prove creative authenticity
    #[pallet::weight(15_000)]
    pub fn prove_creative_authenticity(
        origin: OriginFor<T>,
        work_cid: Vec<u8>,
        emotional_proof: EmotionalProof
    ) -> DispatchResult {
        // Implementation for authenticity proving
    }
}
```
