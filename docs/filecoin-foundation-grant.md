# IPFS Persistence Layer for Affective Media (Rust)

## Project Overview

**Organization**: Compiling.org
**Funding Request**: USD 10,000
**Timeline**: 3 months
**Repository**: https://github.com/compiling-org/nft-blockchain-interactive

## Abstract

We propose developing a Rust-based IPFS integration library that enables content-addressed storage and retrieval of high-fidelity audiovisual and emotional metadata generated by real-time creative systems. This module will serve as the persistence layer for our Neuro-Emotive AI and NUWE (Neuro-Unified Wave Environment) toolkits, ensuring permanent, verifiable decentralized storage of affective media assets.

## Why Filecoin?

Filecoin's decentralized storage network is uniquely positioned to solve the critical challenge of persisting high-fidelity creative data that combines:

- **Audiovisual Assets**: Real-time shader outputs, generative audio, and live performance recordings
- **Emotional Metadata**: Biofeedback data, affective computing states, and performance parameters
- **Temporal Sequences**: Time-series data from live creative sessions

Traditional cloud storage cannot guarantee permanence or verifiability, while centralized NFT platforms lack the bandwidth for high-fidelity media. Filecoin's content-addressing through IPFS CIDs provides the cryptographic guarantees needed for creative provenance and authenticity.

## Technical Approach

### Core Components

1. **CID Generation Engine**
   - Rust library for generating IPFS Content Identifiers from creative data streams
   - Support for multimedia formats (WebM, WAV, JSON metadata)
   - Batch processing for performance optimization

2. **IPFS Pinning Service**
   - Integration with Filecoin storage providers
   - Automated pinning workflows for creative assets
   - Replication strategies for data durability

3. **Metadata Indexing**
   - Content-addressed metadata linking emotional states to media assets
   - Cross-references between live performance data and stored content
   - Query interfaces for retrieving creative session histories

### Implementation Details

```rust
// Core IPFS integration module
pub struct IpfsPersistenceLayer {
    client: IpfsClient,
    filecoin_gateway: FilecoinGateway,
}

impl IpfsPersistenceLayer {
    // Generate CID from creative data
    pub fn generate_cid(&self, data: CreativeData) -> Result<Cid, Error> {
        // Implementation for CID v1 generation
    }

    // Pin content to Filecoin network
    pub fn pin_to_filecoin(&self, cid: &Cid) -> Result<PinResponse, Error> {
        // Implementation for Filecoin pinning
    }

    // Retrieve affective media by emotional state
    pub fn query_by_emotion(&self, emotion_vector: Vec<f32>) -> Result<Vec<Cid>, Error> {
        // Implementation for metadata querying
    }
}
```
