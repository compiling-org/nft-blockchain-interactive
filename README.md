# NFT Blockchain Interactive

Interactive NFT system with Filecoin and NEAR blockchain integration. Smart contracts for connecting Nuwe system to Filecoin and NEAR blockchains.

## ⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS - Active Development**

### **Current Status & Recent Updates**

#### ✅ **Completed Features**
- **Filecoin/IPFS Integration**: NFT metadata storage on decentralized storage
- **NEAR Smart Contracts**: Basic NFT minting contracts for NEAR blockchain
- **Cross-Chain Operations**: Framework for multi-chain NFT interactions
- **Testnet Deployment**: Scripts for deploying to test networks

#### 🔄 **In Development**
- **Interactive NFT**: Dynamic NFT content that responds to external data
