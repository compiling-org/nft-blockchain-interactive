# NFT Blockchain Interactive

A minimal, multi-chain/IPFS-ready framework for generating real-time creative data (from NUWE/shaders/audio) and persisting/tokenizing that data on decentralized networks.

## Overview

This repository serves as the single source of truth for our grant work, containing modules essential to our flagship tools (Neuro-Emotive AI, NUWE, Fractal Modular Shader System). The framework demonstrates how to:

1. **Generate real-time creative data** from NUWE/shaders/audio systems
2. **Persist/Tokenize data** on decentralized networks (Filecoin/IPFS, NEAR, Solana, Polkadot)

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### **Multi-Chain Framework**
- **IPFS Integration**: Content-addressed storage for high-fidelity audiovisual assets
- **NEAR WASM**: Browser-native deployment of creative engines as public goods
- **Solana Programs**: High-throughput real-time metadata logging
- **Substrate Pallets**: Decentralized emotional state proof-of-concept

### **Creative Data Pipeline**
```
NUWE/Shader Engine → Emotional Metadata → IPFS CID → Blockchain Tokenization
```
