- 10% Contingency: Unexpected costs, optimizations ($1K)


===============================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS (per grant)
===============================================================================

Technical Metrics:
- Code coverage > 80%
- Performance targets met (60fps for WASM, 1000 TPS for Solana, etc.)
- All unit and integration tests passing
- Deployed to respective testnets/mainnets

Delivery Metrics:
- All milestones delivered on schedule
- Complete documentation published
- Live demos functioning
- Community feedback incorporated


===============================================================================
RISK MITIGATION
===============================================================================

Technical Risks:
- Blockchain SDK version conflicts → Use separate build environments
- Performance bottlenecks → Early benchmarking and optimization
- Cross-chain compatibility → Standardized data formats

Timeline Risks:
- Scope creep → Strict milestone adherence
- Dependency delays → Parallel development where possible
- Testing delays → Continuous integration from day 1

Budget Risks:
- Gas fee volatility → Use testnets extensively
- Tool costs → Leverage open-source solutions
- Unexpected features → 10% contingency buffer


===============================================================================
NOTES
===============================================================================

- All 6 grants run in PARALLEL (not sequential!)
- Each grant is independent but shares core components
- Regular integration testing ensures cross-compatibility
- Monthly progress reviews to stay on track
- Marketplace/DAO (Mintbase) is completely separate from NEAR grant
- Each module will eventually be split into separate repos post-funding
